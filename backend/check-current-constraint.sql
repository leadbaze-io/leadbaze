  pg_get_constraintdef(oid) as constraint_definition
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conname LIKE '%operation_type%';

-- 2. Verificar todos os valores Ãºnicos na tabela
SELECT DISTINCT operation_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM leads_usage_history

ORDER BY operation_type;

SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM pg_constraint 
  WHERE conname = 'leads_usage_history_operation_type_check'
) as constraint_exists;
